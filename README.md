# Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Spotify datasets using AWS cloud services to derive actionable insights and enhance user experiences on the Spotify platform. The project involves data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development using logistic regression, model evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Gather Spotify datasets and analyze their structure and quality.
- **Data Gathering:** Utilize AWS S3 for storing datasets and implement data ingestion processes.
- **Data Cleaning and Processing:** Cleanse and transform the data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conduct exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
- **ML Model (Logistic Regression):** Develop a logistic regression model to predict user preferences.
- **Model Development:** Train and fine-tune the logistic regression model within the AWS environment.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Evaluating Results:** Interpret the results to derive actionable insights for stakeholders.
- **Business Understanding:** Translate the findings into strategic decisions to enhance user experiences.
