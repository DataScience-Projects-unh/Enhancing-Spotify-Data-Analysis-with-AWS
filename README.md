## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation and setup of the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Knowledge of AWS Services:
Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and functionalities of AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, etc. This will help you understand how to use these services effectively for your project.
2. Data Source:
Ensure you have access to the Spotify datasets or any other data source that you plan to analyze in your project. If the data is not publicly available, make sure you have obtained the necessary permissions to use it.
3. AWS Account:
You must have access to an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources such as S3 buckets, Glue crawlers, Athena queries, etc.
4. AWS Access Key and Secret Key:
Obtain your AWS access key ID and secret access key. You can generate these credentials from the AWS Management Console under IAM (Identity and Access Management)
5. Storage Space:
Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your local machine to store the project files, datasets, and any additional dependencies that you may download during the setup process.
